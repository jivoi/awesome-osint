A curated list of amazingly awesome open source intelligence tools and resources.
[Open-source intelligence (OSINT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence) is intelligence collected from publicly available sources.
In the intelligence community (IC), the term "open" refers to overt, publicly available sources (as opposed to covert or clandestine sources). 

This list is to help all of those who are into Cyber Threat Intellience (CTI), threat hunting, or OSINT. From beginners to advanced. 

Happy hacking and hunting 🧙‍♂️
